# Kickoff App

Welcome to the Kickoff App! This ingenious little application is designed to help you rally your crew and kick off your next adventure, whether it's at a park, a beach, or even your buddy's backyard.

I'm thrilled to announce that the Kickoff App is currently in the final stages of development, and we're gearing up to launch it on the app store for beta testing. Get ready to experience the simplicity and convenience of organizing your next gathering with just a few taps on your phone!

## Features

- Create a new kickoff:
  - Specify the location (park, beach, backyard, or any other epic spot)
  - Indicate your availability to join the fun

## Installation (Development Mode)
